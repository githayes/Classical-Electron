# vacuum-gauge-electron

PDF files re-write the theory of the classical electron in the vacuum gauge.  The vacuum gauge adds a necessary gauge field to the Lorentz gauge condition and leads to a powerful theory of potentials required to propagate field energy (or vacuuum energy) through the Coulomb field of the classical electron. 

Unlike documents related to the vacuum gauge electron, File VGNR-08-2023 explores the Schwarzschild Vacuum with a radiation source.
The authors CV has been made available for review.

File VGNR-6-2023 has been recently added.  This document shows how to perform multipole expansion in the vacuum gauge.
